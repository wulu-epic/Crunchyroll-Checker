Make sure you have a config.json or else it wont work and probably make an error message.

If you dont have it, you can make a new file called, 'config.json' and insert this into it.

```
{
	"timeout": 1500,
	"make_sound_when_hit": false,
	"HELP": {
		"timeout": "sets proxy timeout",
		"make_sound_when_hit": "When you get a hit, it will make a sound."
	}
}
```

FEATURES: 
```
   •Discord webhook support. This logs all your hits into a discord webhook
   •Multi threading. Makes everything much faster.
   •Proxy support. This makes it so you are not using your own IP.
   •Uses android api. This will most likely never be patched!
   •Includes capture. This seperates the free accounts and the premium accounts!
```
